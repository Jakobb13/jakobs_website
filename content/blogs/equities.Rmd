For the equities, finding a proper asset is not hard. As I want to analyse the possibilities for global investors without a local bias, I decided to use the iShares MSCI World ETF. This index represents a global equity portfolio and fits the criteria for the analysis. Also here, the dataset contains observations for the last eight years. A summary can be found below.

```{r equ,  out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}

equ <- read.csv(here::here("data", "URTH.csv"))


equ$Date <- as_date(equ$Date, tz = NULL, format = NULL)

summary(equ)


```

In the chart below we can see the price development over the last eight years. The index delivered strong performance and only at the beginning of the corona crisis a big hit was taken.

```{r equ_plot,  out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}


ggplot(equ, aes(y = Adj.Close,x= Date)) +
  geom_line() +
  #scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) + #Changing to Log Scale
  labs (#Axis Titles and Labels
    x = "Date",
    y = "Price") +
  ggtitle("iShares MSCI World ETF") +
  theme_bw()
```

In the histogram we can see the distribution of the daily returns for the sample. In the equities market, the majority of returns was between 5% and -5%. There have been some outliers, with a more extrem negative side.

```{r equ_ret,  out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}

equ_ret <- equ %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = Adj.Close, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

ggplot(equ_ret, aes(x = daily_returns)) + #Plotting a histogram of price
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), colour = "black", fill = "gray") +
  #scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) + #Changing to Log Scale
  labs (#Axis Titles and Labels
    x = "Return",
    y = "Frequency Density") +
  ggtitle("iShares MSCI World ETF") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(daily_returns)),col='red',size=1, alpha = 0.6)

```
