<p>For the equities, finding a proper asset is not hard. As I want to analyse the possibilities for global investors without a local bias, I decided to use the iShares MSCI World ETF. This index represents a global equity portfolio and fits the criteria for the analysis. Also here, the dataset contains observations for the last eight years. A summary can be found below.</p>
