<p>I was born in a small town in lower Austria, called Wiener Neustadt on the 13th of April in 1996. My hometown is known for its beautiful cathedral, which is shown below. Here I went to grammar school and technical high school before I was drafted to the army.</p>
<p>After spending 2 years in the army, I started studying in Vienna and achieved a Bachelorâ€™s degree in business. During that time, I also did some internships. These were in Equity Research, Deal Advisory, and Corporate Development.</p>
<p>Currently I am studying at LBS and am aiming to achieve a Masters in Financial Analysis. After the degree, I would like to work in equity research.</p>
<p>For the website project I wanted to look at three asset classes and the underlying correlation. I chose that topic because usually amateur investors want to diversify against volatility and it would therefore be interesting to see whether they will be able to achieve that by owning equities, bonds, and real estate.</p>
