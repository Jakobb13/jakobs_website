<p>On this page we can see the correlation analysis between the different asset classes. Surprisingly, real estate and equities have a high correlation of 0.7. This leads to the conclusion, that real estate might not be the best asset to further diversify an equities portfolio. However, equities and fixed income have a lower correlation value of 0.228. In conclusion, an equities investor would be better off diversifying into fixed income than in real estate. Finally, real estate and fixed income have a correlation of 0.347. This is worse than the equities to fixed income value but still it seems that real estate can be used to diversify a fixed income portfolio and the other way around.</p>
